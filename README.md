# Group-No.-10---Stylometry-Based-Authorship-Identitifcation
Every author has an innate style of writing, of which one might not be aware. This has nothing to do with the handwriting, but the world placements, the usage of particular words, the length of sentences, words and paragraphs used. We in our project used machine learning to train our system for particular authors and identify authors based on that.

This project has been done by the BE students of Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, Chembur under the mentorship of Associate Professor Mrs. Sujata Khedkar. The group members were Shashank Agnihotri, Anshul Agarwal and Mahak Pancholi.
